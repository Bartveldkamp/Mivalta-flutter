# Onboarding Screen — Build Report v1

**Executing BS-002-onboarding against SHA `2006dde` → C1/C2 fix SHA `418f8e0`.**

**Branch:** `feature/onboarding`
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Spec:** BS-002-onboarding.md

**Status:** Implementation complete + DR-017 C1/C2 fixes applied.

---

## DR-017 Fixes Applied

| Fix | Issue | Resolution |
|-----|-------|------------|
| **C1** | inputs_json vocabulary mismatch | `age`: band label → representative int; `sex`: lowercase; `ftp_watts`/`threshold_pace_sec_km`: engine schema |
| **C2** | Payoff "—" placeholder at day-zero | Day-zero always shows words ("Good to go") + "Learning you" sub-line |

---

## Screenshots — MAC-SIDE PENDING

| State | Filename | What renders |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Promise | `onb_<SHA>_promise.png` | Lock tile + "Your body.\nYour data." + sub |
| Sports | `onb_<SHA>_sports.png` | Multi-chip sports selection |
| Anchors (IDK) | `onb_<SHA>_anchors-idk.png` | "I don't know" selected for FTP/pace |
| Payoff (words) | `onb_<SHA>_payoff.png` | "Good to go" + "Learning you" (C2: day-zero always words) |

**C2 note:** Only 4 shots needed — payoff-numbers variant removed (day-zero has no readiness number).

**MAC-SIDE:** Capture shots with `--dart-define=BUILD_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)`.

## Engine Wiring — inputs_json + Profile JSON

### Sample inputs_json (C1 corrected vocabulary)

```json
{
  "sports": ["running", "cycling"],
  "aim": "perform",
  "detail": "numbers",
  "age": 35,
  "sex": "male",
  "gear": ["watch", "strap"],
  "ftp_watts": null,
  "threshold_pace_sec_km": null
}
```

**C1 mapping:**
- `age_band: "30–39"` → `age: 35` (representative int)
- `sex: "Male"` → `sex: "male"` (lowercase)
- `sex: "Prefer not to say"` → `sex: null` (engine handles)
- `ftp` → `ftp_watts` (int)
- `threshold_pace` (min/km) → `threshold_pace_sec_km` (sec/km, int)

**Key point:** "I don't know" → `null` for anchors, NEVER 0. The engine handles null anchors cleanly (zero-fabrication tests).

### Sample profile JSON — MAC-SIDE PLACEHOLDER

```json
MAC-SIDE: Run onboarding through the engine and paste the real profile JSON here.

The engine derives:
- goal_class (from aim)
- mesocycle structure (from aim + sports)
- meso_minutes (from aim)
- per-sport anchor gating (null anchors = learn from sessions)
```

**This block must be populated from real engine output before DR submission.**

## BS-002-onboarding Implementation

### Flow — 8 Steps

| Step | Name | Content | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Promise | Center layout, lock tile 72px r22 mint-14%, titleXL "Your body.\nYour data." | ✓ Done |
| 1 | Sports | Multi-chip: Running, Cycling, Walking, Hiking, Stairs, Strength. ≥1 required. | ✓ Done |
| 2 | Aim | Single-option rows: Perform / Stay fit & healthy / A bit of both. Required. | ✓ Done |
| 3 | Detail | Single-option: "Just tell me what to do" / "Show me the numbers too". Required. | ✓ Done |
| 4 | Basics | Age band (5 options) + sex (3 options). Both required. | ✓ Done |
| 5 | Anchors | Conditional (Running/Cycling only). FTP/pace numeric input + "I don't know" chip. | ✓ Done |
| 6 | Gear | Multi-chip optional: Watch, Ring, HR strap, None yet. "None yet" exclusive-toggles. | ✓ Done |
| 7 | Payoff | Mini glow (150px), aim-based line, "Enter MiValta" CTA. | ✓ Done |

### Chrome

| Item | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Progress dots | Step k of 8, greenAccent100 (`stateProductive`) for done, primary for current, muted for pending | ✓ Done |
| Continue button | 52px h, r14, mint, pinned bottom | ✓ Done |
| Back button | Ghost above Continue, from step 2 | ✓ Done |
| Disabled state | 40% alpha when `need()` not satisfied | ✓ Done |
| Entrance animation | Content fade/rise 300ms standardEase, respects `disableAnimations` | ✓ Done |

### Step 5 Anchors — Null-Honest (C1 vocabulary fix)

| Condition | Behavior | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| No Running/Cycling | Step skipped entirely | ✓ Done |
| FTP "I don't know" | `ftp_watts: null` in inputs_json | ✓ C1 fixed |
| Pace "I don't know" | `threshold_pace_sec_km: null` in inputs_json | ✓ C1 fixed |
| Numeric entry | Value stored as int (FTP watts, pace sec/km) | ✓ C1 fixed |

### Step 7 Payoff — Day-Zero Handling (C2 fix)

| State | Glow content | Sub-line | Status |
|-------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Day-zero (onboarding) | "Good to go" (always) | "Learning you — your first few days..." | ✓ C2 fixed |
| With data (Today) | Readiness number | — | n/a (Today handles) |

**C2 rationale:** Fresh engine (zero observations) has no readiness number. Showing "—" in a celebratory glow looks broken. The user's `detail` preference is stored and honored on Today once observations exist.

## Engine Wiring (Step 8 Continue)

| Step | Call | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Marshal RAW answers → `inputs_json` | ✓ Done |
| 2 | `RustEngineBinding.buildOnboardingProfile(inputsJson)` | ✓ Wired |
| 3 | `ProfileService.saveProfile(profileJson)` | ✓ Wired |
| 4 | `binding.writeProfileToVault(...)` | ✓ Wired |
| 5 | `binding.constructEnginesFresh(...)` | ✓ Wired |
| 6 | Route → TodayScreen | ✓ Wired |
| Error | Inline error card, log, do NOT route forward | ✓ Done |

**Debug output:** `inputs_json` and `profile JSON` logged via `debugPrint()`.

---

## Splash Routing Change

| Condition | Previous | Now |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| No auth session | Stub → Today | Stub → Today (Auth not built) |
| Authed + no profile | Stub → Today | → OnboardingScreen ✓ |
| Authed + profile | → Today | → Today |

**`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart:294-298`:**
```dart
if (!hasProfile) {
  return const OnboardingScreen();
}
return const TodayScreen();
```
